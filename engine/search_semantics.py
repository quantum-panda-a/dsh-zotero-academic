"""One definition of search-condition semantics, shared by both backends.

``zotero_advanced_search`` can run two ways: the pyzotero path in
``tools/search.py``, which fetches items and filters them in Python, and the
direct-SQL path in ``local_db.py`` used when ``ZOTERO_SEARCH_BACKEND=sqlite``.
Both have to answer a condition like ``creator contains "muller"`` identically,
or the same tool call returns different results depending on one environment
variable.

Keeping them identical by hand did not work. Three divergences appeared while
#417 was in review — collection recursion, unescaped ``LIKE`` metacharacters,
and, most consequentially, normalization: the Python path folded diacritics on
both sides while the SQL path folded neither, so a creator search for
``muller`` returned 4 items through SQL and 15 through the API on a real
57,000-item library. Every accented spelling was silently missing.

So the semantics live here once, and each backend consumes them rather than
restating them:

* :func:`compare` / :func:`matches` are the Python path's comparator.
* :func:`normalize` is *also* registered on the SQLite connection as
  ``zsearch_norm`` (see :func:`register_sqlite_functions`), so SQL compares
  the same folded form of the same strings via the same Python function.

What is deliberately *not* shared is which column or expression a field maps
to. The SQL path reads Zotero's raw multipart ``date`` value and slices the ISO
prefix, where the pyzotero path can only see the display half; that difference
is a fix, not a divergence, and belongs to each backend.
