"""Adaptive AIMD rate limiter shared by the remote embedding providers.

Two independent token buckets live in one object, because the two ceilings a
provider enforces are not interchangeable:

- **Tokens per minute** (``tpm``) is the one that actually binds for
  embeddings. At a realistic 64 x ~500-token payload a single request costs
  ~32K tokens, so OpenAI's Tier 1 allowance of 1,000,000 TPM caps throughput
  near 31 requests/minute against a 3,000 RPM request allowance — a ~100x
  gap. Pacing by request rate alone is blind to request *size*: a few
  concurrent large batches can burn a minute's token quota in seconds while
  the request rate still looks trivial.
- **Requests per second** (``initial_rps``) matters only for providers or
  proxies that meter requests rather than tokens.

Each bucket is armed only when its ceiling is passed in, and an unarmed
bucket makes :meth:`acquire` a no-op for that dimension. Deliberately, a
throttle never *arms* an unarmed bucket: the TPM ceiling is published per
model and tier, so it is seeded from configuration rather than discovered by
taking 429s. Inferring a rate from the request cadence that just got
throttled means one early 429 can pin throughput far below the true ceiling
for the rest of a multi-hour run, with nothing to distinguish that from
correct behaviour.

On top of each armed bucket sits an AIMD controller: a successful request
nudges the rate up by 5%, a throttled one halves it. Both are clamped to the
configured ceiling, so the rate recovers *to* what the operator asked for and
never past it.

``clock``/``sleep`` are injectable so tests drive the limiter without waiting.
