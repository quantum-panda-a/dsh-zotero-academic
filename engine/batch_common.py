    every status refresh and every import rewrites the manifest it was handed.

    second (``…T10:00:00.000000Z``), because ``"Z" > "."`` — so a pre-upgrade
    run would win a same-second race against a run submitted after the upgrade,

    plus a resubmission within the same second; runs minutes apart — every real
