"""Transient on-disk cache for extracted attachment fulltext.

``update-db --fulltext`` runs in two phases: extract text from every changed
attachment, then embed it. Extraction is cheap per file but not free across a
library — roughly 100 ms per PDF, so a 16,000-item library spends around half
an hour in phase one. Embedding is the phase that fails: rate limits, token
limits, network errors, or the user pressing Ctrl-C. When it does, the
extracted text is lost and the next run pays for phase one all over again.

This module persists that text to disk so a rerun skips straight to embedding.
Entries are evicted once their item's embedding has actually landed in
ChromaDB — the cache exists only to survive the gap between the two phases,
not as a long-lived store.

Layout under ``~/.config/zotero-mcp/fulltext_cache/``:

- ``index.json`` — maps cache keys to entry metadata (source, item_key, ...)
- ``<hash>.txt`` — the extracted UTF-8 text, one file per entry

Concurrency
-----------
Extraction runs in a :class:`~concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` (see
``extraction_workers``), but **only the parent process touches this cache**.
Workers receive a file path and return text; the parent writes each entry as
its future completes. Nothing here needs to be process-safe, and a lock in
this module would not have provided that anyway — each worker is a separate
interpreter.

Writing incrementally rather than once at the end is what makes the cache
useful: a run killed part-way through still leaves every completed extraction
on disk for the next one. :data:`_INDEX_LOCK` guards against the parent
mutating the index from more than one thread.
