"""Attachment text extraction — the single place a file becomes text.

Every fulltext path in zotero-mcp funnels through here: the local-storage
reader (``local_db``), the Web API download path (``client``), the
semantic indexer, and ``zotero_read_pdf_pages``. Keeping one seam means
page provenance, OCR routing and engine choice are decided once instead of
drifting across three call sites.

PDFs are parsed by `pdf-inspector <https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector>`_,
a Rust parser with prebuilt wheels and no Python dependencies. It runs
in-process in roughly a tenth of a second for a journal article, emits
Markdown with real heading structure, and reports which pages carry no text
layer (:attr:`ExtractedDoc.needs_ocr`) — the routing signal an OCR backend
will consume later.

``ExtractedDoc.text`` joins pages with :data:`PAGE_SEPARATOR` so that
character offsets can always be mapped back to a page number. Do not
assemble page-joined text anywhere else.
